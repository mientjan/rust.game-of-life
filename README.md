## Description
This project is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life in Rust. The Game of Life is a cellular automaton that simulates the evolution of a population of cells based on a set of rules. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.

## Features
- Interactive grid where users can toggle cells on and off
- Customizable grid size and cell colors
- Generation counter to keep track of the evolution
- Play, pause, and reset functionality

## Usage
